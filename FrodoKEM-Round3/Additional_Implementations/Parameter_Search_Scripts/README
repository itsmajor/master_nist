==================================

**FrodoKEM** is key encapsulation mechanism based on the learning with errors problem.

This directory contains **Python scripts for selecting parameters**.

Files
-----

The main standalone scripts in the directory are:

- **search_params_pke.py** - searches the parameter space (takes several hours)
- **print_tables_pke.py** - prints out LaTeX tables and C code (takes a few minutes)

There are some additional support scripts in the directory:

- pqsec.py - functions for estimating hardness of various LWE assumptions
- renyi.py - functions for computing Renyi divergence
- discrete_distr.py - functions for manipulating discrete distributions
- failure_prob_pke.py - functions for estimating failure probability of a PKE
- approx_distr.py - functions for finding an optimal approximation to rounded Gaussian

Dependencies
-------

All scripts are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3. Dependencies are `numpy` and
`progressbar2` installable with `pip install`.
