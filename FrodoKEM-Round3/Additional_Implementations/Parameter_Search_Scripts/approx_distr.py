"""Approximates a rounded continuous Gaussian with a bounded-accuracy distribution.

Exhaustively searches the space of feasible distributions for the best
approximation of the target distribution in the sense of minimizing their
Renyi divergence. The feasible distribution is subject to the following
constraints:
  - Bounded support
  - Fixed precision of probability masses.
