Each implementation has a Makefile, this Makefile creates the executable 
PQCgenKAT_sign which was used to generate the KATs files.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How to use config_HFE.h: 
You can modify these parameters:
#define K to choose the level of classical security. It is to put the length 
of SHA3 to 2K bits.
#define HFEn to choose n the degree of extension.
#define HFEv to choose v the number of vinegar variables.
#define HFEm to choose m the number of equation.
#define NB_ITE to choose NB_ITE (cf. specification)
#define HFEDeg : HFEDeg is the degree of HFE polynomial F
#define HFEDegI
#define HFEDegJ
HFEDeg=(2^HFEDegI)+(2^HFEDegJ).

For optimized and additional implementations:
#define __TRINOMHFE__ or __PENTANOMHFE__
#define K3
#define K2
#define K1
To choose the irreductible polynomial of degree n, with NTL format.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How to use config_PKI.h: 
You can modify these parameters:
#define SIGMA the number of original signatures
#define ALPHA the number of equations of derivative public key
#define K_MAC the degree of extension of the MAC

#define __TRINOMPKI__ or __PENTANOMPKI__
#define K_3
#define K_2
#define K_1
To choose the irreductible polynomial of degree K_MAC, with NTL format.

#define Log2_Tau the log of the size of Z, a subset of GF(2^K_MAC)
#define PKI_V the size of O a subset of Z
#define DELTA to take 2^DELTA subtree of Merkle (2^0 to take the root)
