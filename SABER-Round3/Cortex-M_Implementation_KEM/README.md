This repository contains the ARM Cortex-M0 and M4 code for SABER.

The implementation for Cortex-M0 is intended as an unoptimized reference code. It comes with a framework for testing it in the XMC2Go Infineon board.

The implementation for Cortex-M4 gives a trade-off between the fastest implementation available and all the available memory optimizations with a low performance penalty. For either faster or smaller implementations, we refer to the [repository](https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/TCHES2020_SABER) of a [recent publication](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/268.pdf) implementating Saber, or to future updates of this repository.
