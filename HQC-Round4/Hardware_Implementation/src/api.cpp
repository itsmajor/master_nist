/**
 * @brief Keygen of the HQC_KEM IND_CAA2 scheme, API version
 *
 * Generates a key pair for HQC_KEM using a PRNG initialised with the seed array given as input.
 *
 * The internal version has a large signature that includes many arrays that can be shared by multiple functions to
 * reduce hardware usage, as crypto_kem_all_functions_hls does. In crypto_kem_all_functions_hls the arrays are only
 * defined once and shared between keypair enc and dec internal functions. It thus gives a realistic estimation of the
 * cost of implementing the three functions together.
 *
 * The HLS version is the function implemented in hardware when used standalone. It has a reduced signature as it defines
 * the arrays needed for computation locally and calls the internal function. As it includes the arrays needed for the
 * computation, when implemented it provides a realistic estimation of the cost of a standalone implementation.
 *
 * The API version of this function is the same as the HLS one wrapped to use standard C data types instead of HLS data types.
